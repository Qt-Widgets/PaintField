PaintField - A Cross-platform Digital Painting Tool
========

This app is currently under development. The source files are licensed under LGPL.
The project name and the license might be changed in the future.

## - To Build -

PaintField depends on the following libraries: libzip, libmalachite (Malachite[http://github.com/iofg2100/Malachite], my project in GitHub).
Also, libmalachite depends on libfreeimage.

To build PaintField, follow these steps:

	1. Install libzip and libfreeimage.
	2. Build Malachite.
	3. Make PaintField refer to Malachite's binary and headers. (e.g., use QMake's LIBS and INCLUDEPATH)
	4. Build PaintField.

Now you can start using PaintField!!
(sorry PaintField is still UNDER DEVELOPMENT and very useless ><)
